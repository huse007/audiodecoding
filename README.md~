## Audio Decoding Test

### Tools
*For MacOS:* Install cmake and Xcode (just for the sake of having Apple's clang installed).

*For Windows:* Just install Visual Studio Community 2017. (Grab it here: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)

### Overview
There is a vs and cmake project with an empty FLAC decoder implementation. It already includes libFLAC as static library and the headers in place.

The main function receives an input FLAC file path.

[Visual studio only] For your convenience, the configuration of the project already sends the first argument to a local FLAC file sample  :).

The app should generate a valid WAV file with the given file decoded PCM. Implement the blank FLACDecoder class given in the example.
